# Profit--prediction-of-50-startups
In the given dataset, we have information about the R&D Spend, Administration Cost, and Marketing Spend of 50 companies, along with the profit earned by each company. Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the profit of a company based on its R&D Spend, Administration Cost, and Marketing Spend.
